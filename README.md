# Linked List

This project is meant to showcase one's understanding of simple data structures. In this case, programmers must create a functional linked list. The assignment page can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists). This assignment allowed us to use both class based syntax and factory functions.
